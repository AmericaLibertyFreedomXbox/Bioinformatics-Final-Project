### Project Requirements:
*Write a bioinformatics program, in the language of your choice. All source code used must be your own; library packages may be used only with permission.*
	
1. A DNA or RNA sequence is read from a file.
2. The program translates the entire sequence using all six possible reading frames.
3. All open reading frames identified are highlighted.
Note: you may not use Biopython or other available packages for this assignment.

Specifications:
* DNA/RNA sequences are read from a specified file
* The sequence is written in the 5' to 3'.
* The program translates all 6 reading frames, and open reading frames are highlighted.
* The program is user-friendly and handles both lower- and upper-case nucleotide characters.

#### Notes:
1. Write a program using Python that takes in a sequence
	* must account for DNA and RNA and lowercase.
*GGCTCccGGTGTCTGCAGTGGAGCtGGGGGCGGAAgcatGAGGCTAACGGCttG*

3. Translate the nucleotide triplets into codons for six possible reading frames.
4. Highlight 'MET' codons.
